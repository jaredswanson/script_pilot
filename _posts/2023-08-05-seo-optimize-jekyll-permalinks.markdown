# How to Optimize Permalinks for SEO and Readability in Your Jekyll Site


Permalinks play a crucial role in structuring the URLs of your Jekyll site's pages and posts. You have the power to choose the right permalink structure, which can have significant benefits for Search Engine Optimization (SEO), user experience, and overall website readability. In this blog post, we'll explore why you might want to consider updating your permalinks and demonstrate how to configure permalinks in Jekyll to improve SEO and create user-friendly URLs.

## Benefits of Structuring Permalinks Effectively

1. **SEO Improvement**: Search engines like Google often consider the words in URLs when determining the relevance of a web page to a search query. Having descriptive and keyword-rich URLs can improve the chances of your pages ranking higher in search results.

2. **Readability and User Experience**: Clear and logical URLs can make it easier for you and your website visitors to understand the content of a page just by glancing at the link. A well-structured permalink can also improve the user experience and make it more likely for you and your visitors to share your content.

3. **Consistency and Organization**: Organizing your content under specific categories can add consistency to your site's structure. It allows you to easily identify the type of content you're accessing and encourages you to explore related posts.

## Updating Permalinks in Jekyll

For this guide, we'll focus on a common scenario where all "posts" on your Jekyll site should be placed under the "learn" category.

**Step 1: Open `_config.yml`**

The first step is to open your Jekyll site's `_config.yml` file, where you'll make the necessary changes.

**Step 2: Understand Permalink Configuration**

Jekyll uses the `permalink` setting to generate URLs for posts and pages. By default, the permalink is set to the date-slug format (`/:year/:month/:day/:slug/`), but you want to change it to include the "learn" category (`/learn/:slug/`) for all your posts.

**Step 3: Add Permalink Configuration**

To update the permalink for all your posts to include the "learn" category, add the following configuration to your `_config.yml` file:

```yaml
defaults:
  - scope:
      path: ""
      type: posts
    values:
      permalink: /learn/:slug/
```

**Step 4: Move Existing Posts**

If your existing posts are not in the "_posts" directory, ensure that you move them there. Jekyll looks for posts inside the "_posts" directory by default.

**Step 5: Add Front Matter to Existing Posts**

Ensure that all your post files (Markdown files) have the appropriate front matter, including the `layout` and `title` attributes. For example:

```markdown
---
layout: post
title: Welcome to Jekyll
---
```

**Step 6: Restart Jekyll Server**

Restart your Jekyll server to apply the changes (`jekyll serve`).

## Conclusion

By configuring permalinks effectively in your Jekyll site, you can enhance its SEO, readability, and overall user experience. Structuring your URLs with relevant keywords and logical categories can lead to better search engine rankings and make it easier for you and your visitors to understand and share your content. Whether you have an existing Jekyll site or are starting a new one, taking the time to optimize your permalinks will undoubtedly pay off in the long run. Happy blogging!
